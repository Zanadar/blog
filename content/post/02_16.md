##### Did
- Meditated
- Morning checkin
- Learned about `structs`, `slices`, and `maps` in `Go`
- Continue to be amazed by `Go` (I've never worked in compiled or typed language)
- Continue to have my brain broken by `Go` (its really weird to have to declare everything and think through a problem so thoroughly before writing the code)
- Implemented a simple word counting program in `Go`
- Had lunch with Ben, Ryan, and Shaun
- Spent a long time talking with ^^^ about pointers (another new concept for me)
- Think about how weird pointers are. `Ruby` is pass by value but there are conventions to prevent you from mutating the underlying object (functions that mutate have a `!` in them eg `flatten!`)
- Except in `Ruby` all vars are pointers/references (I'm still not clear if those are different)

```ruby
a = *(1..5)
# This is a _splat_ operator not a pointer
b = a
a << 6
puts b
     => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

- Read through [Bastard book of Ruby on collections](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/collections/)
- Messed around with some array reversing in Ruby. These return a new array and reverse in place, respectively.

```ruby
a = *(1..10)

def reverse(arr)
  temp = []
  arr.each do |x|
    temp.unshift(x)
  end
  temp
end

def clever_reverse!(arr)
  last_index = arr.length - 1
  for x in 0..arr.length/2
    arr[x], arr[last_index - x] = arr[last_index - x], arr[x]
  end
  arr
end

test = reverse(a)
puts "A is #{a}"
puts "test is #{test}"
clever_revers!(a)
puts "a is now #{a}"
      =>
      A is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
      test is [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
      a is now [10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
- Went to jobs talk
- Read [this great article](http://www.mikeperham.com/2014/11/26/building-a-binary-tree-with-enumerable/) on binary trees in ruby using the `Ennumerable` module
