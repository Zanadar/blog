I'm sitting at home with a bit of a cold, trying to think over everything that I did and thought last week - and I'm having trouble. I'm exhausted; exhausted and so happy.

It's hard for me actually summarize this week because it was such a whirlwind. On the train yesterday I ticked of a list of things I did that could be expanded into a whole blog-post: 

- Published three NPM modules
- Started to understand binary operations and bitshifting for the first time
- Learned some Regex techniques. 
- Met about 60 new people.
- Build a whole bunch of log chips.
- Learned how to randomize the order of an array in Javascript.

I could go on like this for a long time, but it didn't really help me decide what to actually write about. And so I asked my Justine about how to write some sort of summary post. Her suggestion was to try to think of the most significant thing I learned.

Looking over that list above I can't help but marvel at what I can get done with focus, support, and some self belief; its the start of a great journey. And its my journey to make.

And __That__ is what last week taught me. 

I haven't quite figured out how this is happening, but it's magical. It seems that simply spending time at RC with positive people, with shared focus, who don't engage in any kind of judgement about what we (any of us) can or can't do or understand changes how I think. This environment has helped me realized how often I judge myself about what I _don't_ know and what I _can't_ do. Usually this comes by way of comparison with someone else. But it never helps me move forward.

Everyone here at RC is just doing _their_ thing. 

There's no assumptions about your background or your interests or your path; there's simply support to become a better programmer. And that's powerful. I can see the power of that simple idea as I tick through my `Did` lists. I'm pretty shocked actually, and humbled to be here. I can't wait for the weeks to come.
