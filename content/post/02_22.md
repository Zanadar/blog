##### Did
- This was my first day writing my own `Go` (rather than working through a tutorial). Don't have much to show for the day, but I learned a lot.
- Worked on part 1 of lab 1 the CSail 6.824 distributed systems course
 - I Wrote the `doMap` function and have most of `doReduce` working
 - WHOAH `Go` has lots of boilerplate. Its super explicit and I like it a lot, but you write a lot of of code to do things that I'm used to writing in a line in eg. `Ruby`.
 - Also error handling is ~weird~ (No `exceptions?` No `Try/Catch`)
 - But I'm getting used to the type stuff and its actually kinda nice have safety and having to think of things ahead of time
- Had our Nand2Tetris sectional
- Went for dumplings with Shaun and Karan
- Had a nice coffee walk with Karan and Ben
- Walked to ebay for Evan's talk and chatted with Jake about security and crypto stuff
- Attend Evan's talk on `Elm`
