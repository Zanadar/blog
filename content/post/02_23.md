##### Did
- Ran
- Meditated
- Got my `doReduce` to work with help from Oguz
 - It turns out it was marshalling & unmarshalling the JSON in some weird way. Results are [here](https://github.com/Zanadar/6.824-golabs-2016/compare/lab1.1)
- Talked a lot about ethics at lunch with Mikey &c
- Read some blog posts about using Anki to help with learning code. I figure :shrug: why not?
- Set up Anki for SRS. I've tried this before and found Anki's interface weird. This time I got over the hurdle and will stick with it.
- Wrote out some Anki cards for algorithms, `Ruby`, and `Git`
- Paricipated in first crit group. I bumbled my way though talking about my `doMap` and `doReduce` code. Not prepared...
- Looked at:
