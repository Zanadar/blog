I've been meaning to start a blog for a long time and sometimes the best way to get started on a habit is to find an excuse. So...I'm starting at the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com) next Monday, Feb. 8, 2016 in the Spring 1 batch. I'll be writing daily update posts and longer summary posts once a week.👏

##### Why
Its been a great couple years from my journey of zero coding (okay I could hack around a terminal a bit) to becoming a (sorta) competent programmer. I've worked mostly in Ruby and Rails, with a bit of Javascript. Rails was a great entree to programming - and yet - well I won't speak ill if the dead. Along the way I fell in love with the so called 'open web' (mostly `Javascript`). I've been wanting to get much better as a javascript programmer and really build some cool stuff with `node` but life as usual kinda gets in the way...Until it provides you an opening you never saw coming.

##### How🤘
The company where I worked folded and this kinda threw my plans into the works...but as I said before having
an excuse from the universe can really make things easier. And so rather than going right back on the market I
get to spend a few months getting __a lot__ better as a programmer and, more importantly, connecting with a community of people who really love this stuff.

Stay tuned. Its gonna fuckin' rule.👻
