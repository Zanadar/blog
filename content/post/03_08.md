##### Did:
- Ran
- First silent meditation (I've been doing guided for about a month). 5 mins as a start. Flew by.
- Checkin
- Spent the morning working on IO for hack assembly.
- I'm getting to like working with assembly a lot. Its really hard and granular, but there's something super cool about working with the computer that deeply.
- Went through the intro for MicroCorruption, which is a matasano assembly hacking game.
- Talked to one of the new RC facilitators, James, when I was having a problem with above. This was super helpful and fun. Explaining it to him gave me a better understanding of what was going on and eventually helped me get the code working.
- Got falafel w. Karan
- Chat w. K and james. We talked about science infrastructure, job stuff, and Georgia Tech
- Spent the afternoon working on Raft. I've done a lot of refactoring in order to make the code more understandable.
This included moving the `handleVoting` code into its own method and using `time.Ticker` instead of countdowns that I was resetting all the time. I also managed to fix a bunch of race conditions, which should make things saner....but I broke the second test. Will get that working again tomorrow.
