#### Did:
- Ran
- Meditated
- Checkin
- Worked on Raft in Go
- Learned the joy of (ab)using emojis in my debugging print statements
- Got some recommendations about podcasting from Pam Selle and others. I've been thinking of putting my audio knowledge to use on making a podcast about distributed systems. I'm one of those people that learns by talking (this drives Justine crazy b/c I have to talk through everything) so I figure it'd be a great way to learn about the subject and to get to know people in that community.
- Had a falafel with John
- More work on Raft
- Chatted with Mateusz about his app and learned about Google Data store
- Went to presentations
