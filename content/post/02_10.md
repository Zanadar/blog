##### Did
- Meditated
- Had lunch with former Skilledup people -> Ali got a job at Twitch 🎮
- Installed Java ☕️
- Installed Nand2Tetris tools
- Had Nand2Tetris working session
- Worked on Boolean algebra -> Write out truth table, come up with Boolean formula for a chip, check it
  against the truth table
- Installed vim syntax highlighting for Nand2Tetris
- Went to session about choosing and scoping projects
- Worked through `Not`, `And`, `Nor`, `Xor`, `Mux`, `Demux` chips using primitives (starting with `Nand`)
- Learned about [De Morgan's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws)

>The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations.

>The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.

``` bash
!(A && B) == (!A) | (!B)
!(A | B) == (!A) && (!B)
```
 > If you think this is silly (talking to myself here...) look at how Yan used DeMorgan to find [minifier backdooring bug](https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/)

- Built a 1-to-2 line decoder with tests in `hdl`. This is apparrently useful for bussing.
- Build a Node module called `uptick` for a transform stream that increments numbers in brackets. This is useful for eg `Or(a=in[1], b=in[0],
  out=out[2])`
- This may be something I can use in Vim -> pipe a buffer to command line and back to buffer
- Started working on making it a CLI
