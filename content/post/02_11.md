##### Did
- Built a module called `uptick` to help with Nand2Tetris work
- Got `uptick` to work as a global bash thing

```
$ echo -e 'test[0]\n test[0]' | uptick
$ test[0]
  test[1]
```
- Most cool is that you can select text in vim and run `'<,'>!uptick` and it'll work!!!
- Meditated
- Did some bad vim search-replace
- Updated Readme and published new version of `uptick`
- Completed the chips in Ch. 1 of Nand2Tetris
- Spent a long time tinkering with Wireshark to figure out Bittorrent protocol stuff
- Got a tracker announce request working for `Bittorrent`
- Started the process of parsing the `peers` key in the tracker response -> Mostly looks like garbage
- Presentations
- Game Night
- Had really good talks with:
   - __Ben__ (thanks for the help on the encoding issue for the bittorrent `peer` (six bytes each represent the ip and port)
  - __Hari__ (thanks for the awesome stuff about network program and the encouragment to stretch myself)
