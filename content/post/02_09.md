###### Did
- Met with Nand2Tetris Group
- Had lunch with sam and andrew LG
- Learned about wireshark for bittorrent -> Open up some torrent, filter with the bitorrent filter, and as
  that populates, you can follow a conversation (in statics) with the current filter applied, and then filter by that
  conversation.
- Read API for `bencode` package on NPM (really good, takes data an object, can output object or buffers)
- Read through the code of `bittorrent-tracker` which was helpful for understanding the flow of things.
- Started to read through documenation about encoding in JS -> still confused by
> "The url must be properly
  percent encoded using the “%nn” format, where ‘nn’ is the hexadecimal value of the byte or reserved
  character. Unreserved characters need not be escaped (see link for reference). For example, the escaped form
  of the binary string ‘\xab’ is ‘%AB’ and the escaped form of ‘\x12\x34\x56\x78\x9a’ is ‘%124Vx%9A’. " but it
  seems to be something that the node querystring library can handle

- Got a basic torrent read going and filtering on the array of trackers, which are http & udp
