🎉☀️ Beautiful day.
##### Did:
- Meditated
- Worked on Raft. ugh. I'm really stuck. I refactored the code so that all the loops have their own timers and dft `goroutines` aren't sharing and modifying the same clocks. This should be better, but I haven't gotten it to work.
- Started to plan for the DHT and bittorrent clients.
- Nand2 sectional. We talked about the potential hidden instructions in the ALU. Very interesting.
