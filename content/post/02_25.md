##### Did
- Ran. Weather was ‚òÄÔ∏è great.
- Meditated
- Went to Evan's talk about type inference. Interesting but a bit over my head as I'm just starting to get experience in a typed language.
- Worked on slides for my talk [MapReduce for Farmers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EK-1Rx7OsPNrNnhbgyE8tDTWUaP2doPA0gTV9AeLz5w/edit?usp=sharing)
(an idea I had on my run this morning)
- Coded a `bit`, `16bit Register`, `RAM8`, and `RAM64`. These last two were awesome as they're essentially recursively structured registers of registers and registers of RAM8. Another example of amazing complexity out of somewhat simple pieces.
- Went to crit group and Andrew talked about his JS program for demonstrating Dijkstra's algorithm
- Prepped for talk
- Watched awesome presentations
- Delivered talk (I thought it went pretty well even though I was nervous). This was a big first step. One of my goals at RC is to improve technical writing and presenting skills, so these Thursday nights are awesome for that. I also made a joke about üí©. Now I just gotta write about more technical subjects...
- Hung out after presentations for pizza and good chats with John and Karan.
