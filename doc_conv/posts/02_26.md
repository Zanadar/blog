###### Did
- Meditated
- Worked on recursive algorithms
- Installed and set up `jruby_processing`
- Did some basic examples with above
- Wrote a Sierpinski gasket, which is a nice example of recursion.

- Pertinent Code for above:
```ruby
def drawSquare(x, y, side)
  stroke 4
  if side <= 10
    fill(x % 255, y % 255, 255)
  else
    no_fill
  end
  rect x, y, side, side
  return unless side > 10
  drawSquare(x - side /2, y- side/2, side/2)
  drawSquare(x + side /2, y- side/2, side/2)
  drawSquare(x - side /2, y+ side/2, side/2)
end
```

- Did some work on sorting algorithms, especially merge-sort
