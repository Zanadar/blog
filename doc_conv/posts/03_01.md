_First day of the new month_ 🗓
###### Did:
- Ran
- Meditated
- Read about the [Raft protocol](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/raft-extended.pdf). This paper is awesome. I love that understandability was a design goal. That's really inspiring (they also attempt to prove that its actually better on that score).
- Made Aeropress coffee inverted style ☕️ ⤵ ala 
- Checkin
- Watched lecture on Raft
- Read/Watched Raft explanation
- Made lots of chicken scratch 🐔 diagrams and sticky notes of Raft

- Fiddled with vim for a long time and got ctags working thanks to `tagbar`. This makes navigating Go files much much easier.
- Walked to Houston halal cart for falafel on rice 🍚. Very good.
- Started on raft election code. This involves creating the RequestVote RPC and the appendEntries RPC, and creating all sorts of structs and timers so the servers in the cluster have everything they need for Raft to work (at least that's the theory...)
- I might do a presentation about voting in Raft, or maybe about timekeeping in distributed systems this Thursday (probably the latter).
- Had a nice walk with Ben, Jake, Kaley, and Oguz.
- Nerded out about books with Jake. 
- More work on Raft code.
