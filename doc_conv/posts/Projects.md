I just finished up a stint at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com), which is a sort of educational retreat for programmers.  While I was there I worked on a number of projects and topics, some of which I explored on this blog. Below are links to some of the major projects I completed.

The big project I'm working on these day is 
> ##[MTA.FYI](http://mta.fyi)

Which aims to bring some sense of accountabilty to the New York subway system. At the moment, it's an app to track the uptime of lines using data provided by the MTA. In the future, riders will be able to weigh in on and it'll provided some sort of predictive metrics.
