###### Did:
- Ran
- Meditated
- Checkins
- Worked on a little bit of my Raft implemetation. I'm gonna shelve it for a while. I feel like I learned a ton, but don't have too much to show for it...but I'm trying to be okay with that.
- Started reading the paper about the Kademlia DHT.
- Played with hashing & XORing in `Go`. I made a little go playground here: https://play.golang.org/p/F8CtJsvHs_
- Practiced binary operations and counting by hand
- Wrote some simple programs to create Sha1 hashes and XOR them against each other. Kademlia uses this for distance.
- Presentations
