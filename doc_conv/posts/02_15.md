###### Did
- Meditated
- Over the weekend I decided that I should keep writing Ruby since I've already put in the time (and I was struggling with some simple syntax ðŸ˜• ).
- So I'll do some stuff in Ruby (algorithms, writing my Nand2Tetris compiler, maybe crypto challenges)
- I also decided that the MIT distributed systems course is a good excuse to start learning Go.
- Had our Monday Nand2Tetris meeting
- Kaley helped me understand why AND is like multiplying and OR is like adding (Those are their logical symbols). IE.
```hdl
0 AND 1 = 0
1 AND 1 = 1
1 AND 0 = 0

1 OR 0 = 0 
1 OR 1 = 1 (11 with a carry bit)
```
- Build half, full, and 16bit adders, and 16bit incrementer.
- Had checkin
- Got Banh Mi with Oguz
- Met Liz
- Started reading _MapReduce_ paper
- Finished working through `Go` Tour module on Flow Control and struggled with using Newton's method for doing square roots where the loop terminates when the delta is small (that's a jumble of words there...)
- Started working through a Count-Sort algorithm in `Ruby`
- Some `Ruby` to fill an array with random values: 
```ruby
myArr = Array.new(100) { rand(1..17) }
```
- Re-Setup my `Ruby` dev environment
- Went to algorithms lecture on time complexity by David and NP problems by Matthew
- Dinner
- Talk @ RC on `Perl 7`
