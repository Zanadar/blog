###### Did
- Meditated
- Finished reading about [GFS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/gfs.pdf)
- Started learning `Erlang`. I already love it. Pattern matching is ==amazebazookas==.
- Read ch2, 3, 4, && 5 of [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/)
- Compared to quicksort in other languages, here's `Erlang`:
```erlang
lc_quicksort([]) -> [];
lc_quicksort([Pivot|Rest]) ->
  lc_quicksort([Smaller || Smaller <- Rest, Smaller =< Pivot]) % This is list comprehensions
  ++ [Pivot] ++
  lc_quicksort([Larger || Larger <- Rest, Larger > Pivot]).
```
Whoah. This doesn't necessarily perform awesomely, as you're allocating a bunch of new lists and walking over them a lot, but still...the code is really cool. And quite clear, even after only a day of working on the language. I like this weird language a lot. From here out I'm gonna do ==Erlang Mondays==.

- Went to the Algorithms group talk by David and Shaun on some aspects of graph algorithms. This was really cool. I immediately saw how powerful and useful understanding graphs could be (as the represent relationships between things). They demonstrated some algorithms related to dependency and min spanning trees, used with concrete exampled of both (the order you take classes in and most cheaply routing a network to all cities in a graph).
- Went to see Tega Brain talk about her work.
