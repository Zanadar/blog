###### Did:
- Ran
- Meditated
- Restarted my Raft code ie I 🔥ed my code from the last 7 days because it was 💩🍝 (crap spaghetti). 
- So far this^^ has been a really good decision. Things are going much more smoothly and the code is actually understandable. 
- I'm leaving off today mid-work. Currently attempting to implement a stateful `goroutine` that I can send a `VoteRequestReply` to, that will then send back an election result on a channel I provide it (the idea being to select against that channel and the timers). I'm not sure this is the the right way to handle elections, but for now the basic skeleton code of the loops and the timers is working. This [post](https://gobyexample.com/stateful-goroutines) may be useful....
- Read a [good blogpost](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/distributed-systems-theory-for-the-distributed-systems-engineer/) on distributed systems theory for engineers. This post lead me to a couple others that I browsed.
- Talked about GSOC with Karan and Oguz.
- Started drafting my Thursday talk
